# Code organization

# Skeleton 

- DESCRIPTION : To store important metadata about your package.

- NAMESPACE : Defines the functions, classes, and methods that are imported into the name space, and exported for users. 

- NEWS : Keeps track of changes to the code from one version to the next.

- CITATION : Appropriate citations must be included in help pages and vignettes; this aspect of documentation is no different from any scientific endeavor.

- Including Data

- Package Documentation (vignettes, man pages)

- Unit Tests 

- .gitignore : Bioconductor requires a git repository for submission.

## DESCRIPTION 

 - The job of the DESCRIPTION file is to store important metadata about your package

# Roxygen

## Why do we need documentation? 

- Documentation is one of the most important aspects of a good package. 
- Without it, users wonâ€™t know how to use your package. 
- Documentation is also useful for future-you (so you remember what your functions were supposed to do), and for developers extending your package. 

## How to use Roxygen ? 

- Add roxygen comments to your .R files.

- Run devtools::document() (or roxygen2::roxygenise()) to convert roxygen comments to .Rd files. (devtools::document() calls roxygen2::roxygenise() to do the hard work.)

- Roxygen will also create a NAMESPACE for you, and will manage the Collate field in DESCRIPTION.

# Unit Tests

- Testing is a vital part of package development. 
- It ensures that your code does what you want it to do. 
- RUnit or testthat packages to write unit tests.

## Example

## Test Coverage 

- Test coverage refers to the percentage of your package code that is tested by your unit tests. 
- Packages with higher coverage have a lower chance of containing bugs.
